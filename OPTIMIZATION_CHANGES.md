# KP-Data Optimization Changes

## Performance Improvements Implemented

We've made several important optimizations to improve the performance and reliability of the KP-Data application:

### 1. Data Processing Optimizations

- **Memory Usage Optimization**: Added a function to convert DataFrame columns to more memory-efficient data types
  - Float64 → Float32
  - Int64 → Int32
  - Low-cardinality strings → Categorical types

- **Vectorized Operations**: Replaced row-wise operations with more efficient vectorized operations
  - Optimized deduplication key creation to use vectorized string methods instead of row-by-row apply
  - Replaced lambda functions with direct column operations where possible

- **Date Field Repair**: Added automatic date field repair to address high rates of invalid dates
  - Uses available dates to infer missing course_version dates
  - Sets a reasonable far-future date for courses with missing discontinued dates

### 2. Streamlit Performance Enhancements

- **Caching**: Added caching to key functions to prevent unnecessary recomputation
  - Applied `@st.cache_data` decorators to data loading and processing functions
  - Added caching to visualization functions with appropriate TTL (time-to-live) settings

- **Visualization Improvements**: Enhanced visualization functions with:
  - More efficient data filtering and preparation
  - Better handling of missing data
  - More flexible parameter options

### 3. Code Structure Improvements

- **Function Documentation**: Enhanced documentation for functions with detailed parameter descriptions
- **Type Hinting**: Added proper type hints for improved code clarity and error prevention
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling for missing or invalid data

## Expected Benefits

- **Reduced CPU Usage**: The application should now use significantly less CPU by:
  - Avoiding redundant calculations
  - Using more efficient data operations
  - Caching results appropriately

- **Lower Memory Footprint**: Memory usage should be reduced through:
  - More efficient data type selection
  - Better handling of string data
  - Proper garbage collection opportunities

- **Better Data Quality**: Data quality has been improved through:
  - More robust date handling
  - Better validation of critical fields
  - Automatic repair of common issues

- **Improved User Experience**: Users should notice:
  - Faster dashboard loading
  - More responsive visualizations
  - Better handling of large datasets

## Next Steps

1. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor the application to ensure optimizations are effective
2. **Additional Caching**: Identify any remaining slow operations for further caching
3. **Further Optimization**: Look for opportunities to chunk large data operations
4. **Category Confidence Scoring**: Implement the planned improvements to category detection
